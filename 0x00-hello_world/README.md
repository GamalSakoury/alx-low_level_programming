<pre>
   From problem 0 till problem 3 I was using gcc doc and search about them.
   <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Overall-Options.html#Overall-Options">the link for the gcc doc</a>
   the most used ones -c , -E, -S.

   in problem 4 and 5, I am printing string -messages- using different stdout functions like (puts, printf).
   in problem 6, by using the sizeof function to know the size of the data type.
